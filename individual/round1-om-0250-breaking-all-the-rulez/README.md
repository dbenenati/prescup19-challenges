## Background

Your firewall configuration has been lost and you must recover it. Fortunately, ten backup configurations were
identified, but only one is the correct ruleset that satisfies the necessary conditions for your network. The filename
(without the extension) of the correct ruleset is your flag for submission. For example: Ruleset-a2s3n4b3x5c7.

## Getting Started

You have been provided with a network diagram, a set of 10 PfSense firewall ruleset configurations (in PDF format), and
a README file that includes your desired network conditions with a brief set of directions. You must examine each
ruleset configuration to determine whether it matches or violates the necessary conditions. Once a ruleset violates the
desired outcome it can be discarded as a possibility.
