## Background

Modern communications protocols allow one protocol to be encapsulated within another. While this offers great
flexibility for designing systems, attackers often take advantage of it too. An adversary can use encapsulation to
"tunnel" through an otherwise well-secured network. Can you find the tunnel and figure out what passed through?

## Traffic Analysis
You are provided with a CD-ROM containing a packet capture. Analyze the traffic capture using any tools you feel are
appropriate to find the flag. The flag is in the format of the string `flag:{32 characters}`.
