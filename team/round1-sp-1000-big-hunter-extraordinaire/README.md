## Background
Software bugs can pose a serious threat to an organization. In order to prevent software bugs that could result in
exploitable vulnerabilities, CERT has created a set of rules and recommendations known as the
[SEI CERT C Coding Standard](https://resources.sei.cmu.edu/downloads/secure-coding/assets/sei-cert-c-coding-standard-2016-v01.pdf).
You must correct several small programs that violate this standard.

## Getting started

Inside the `challenge` folder are four source code files. In the competition, you were required to correct, compile, and
execute them according to instructions found inside of a README document. However, you will not have the grading server
that was running during the competition, and will need to locate the violations and check your work with the solution
guide.
